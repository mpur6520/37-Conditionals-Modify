# Task Modify

Adapt the code so that:
- The user is asked at the end if they guessed correctly
- If they did, display a “Well done” message
- If they didn’t, display a “Never mind” message
- As well checking whether the answer is too high or too low, add a line that checks whether the guess is equal to the answer and if it isn’t, displays a “Bad luck” message


- Add comments to explain what you have changed.

## Help! My code doesn't work
Make sure that you check for the following things:

- a colon at the end of each if and else line.
- each branch is indented unsing the TAB key (not just spaces)
- no condition after 'else'
- a **double** equals in the condition when chcking that two pieces of data are the same.
